"""Tasks

This function is used by a Worker to execute its job (i.e. its 
Employer's complex task).

The worker's script connects a socket which listens for a 'job_finished' 
emission on a dedicated namespace for the worker (specified by the worker's 
`model_id`). When the socket hears the 'job_finished' emission, it replaces 
the worker's loading page with a request to the worker's `callback` view 
function.
